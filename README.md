## 1_raw_data/
This folder contains raw data used as input for the clinical trial simulation.

### Simulated Datasets (location: '1_raw_data/simulated')

| File           | Description                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 'dm.csv' | 300 randomized subjects (ID, age, sex, treatment group...) |
| 'vs.csv'   | Vital signs (TEMP and 02SAT) at days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28   |

#### Notes:
- 'AESOC' is mapped from 'AETERM' using a predefined dictionary of 5 organ classes.
- AE start and end dates are randomized within 14 and 28 days post-treatment start.
- The simulation is fully reproducible using a fixed seed.
- Each subject from "dm.csv" can have between 0 and 3 simulated adverse events.
-The probabilities are adjusted to reflect clinical realism:
  - Events are **more severe** in 'PBO',
  - Recovery is **less likely** in 'PBO',
  - Drug-event relationship is **more likely** in 'VRB'.

# CDISC SDTM Package - Pinnacle 21  Validation Report

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to structure clinical trial data according to CDISC SDTM standards and to validate it using industry tools.
- Tool used : Pinnacle 21 Community v4.1.0
- Standards: SDTM IG 3.4 / CDISC SDTM v1.7
- Output: define.xml, .xpt domains, and Pinnacle 21 validation report

## Limitations and Known Validation Issues
This is a **non-regulatory, personal project** created without access to commercial licenses or real patient data. As such, some validation issues reported by Pinnacle 21 are expected and justificable:

### Dictionary Configuration
- **medDRA** and **SNOMED CT** were **not configured**, as they are commercial terminologies not available in the Community version of Pinnacle 21.
- Result: some checks for **Adverse Events** and **Trial Summary** were not executed.

### Missing Datasets
- Some standard SDTM datasets (e.g. 'TS', 'LB', 'SE', 'DS', 'TA', 'TE') were **not included** or **simulated**, as no real clinical trial was conducted.
- Result: presence checks triggered in Pinnacle 21.

### Codelist Violations
- A few variable values (e.g. 'AEOUT', 'AEACN', 'AEPRESP') do not match the **non-extensible CDISC Controlled Terminology**.
- Result: synthetic values were used for demonstration purposes (e.g. "RECOVERED" instead of "RECOVERING").

### Data Consistency Issues
- Some records show **duplicate or inconsistent values**, especially in Adverse Event qualifiers.
- These are artifacts of manually generated demo data and do not reflect real clinical inconsistencies.

## Justifications

All validation issues mentioned above are consistent with the scope of a training or portfolio project. This repository is not intended for regulatory submission, but rather to demonstrate:

- understanding of SDTM domains and metadata structure;
- ability to prepare datasets for validation using industry tools;
- familiarity with CSDISC compliance processes and common issues.


## Validation Summary
- Total records processed: 5,292
- Validation engine: FDA 2405.2
- Rejects: 1
- Common issues: missing datasets, non-extensible codelist violations, duplicate values

## Disclaimer 
This project is not intended for regulatory submission, but it is intended to showcase data structuring skills in SDTM format and familiarity with clinical standards and tools. All data is synthetic and does not represent real patients or studies.

## Dataset: ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)

### üìú Purpose
Builds the master subject-level ADaM dataset from SDTM Demographics (`DM`).

### üì• Inputs
| File    | Location         | Role                                  |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `dm.csv`| `2_sdtm/data/`   | Demographics source (SDTM-style CSV)  |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps
1. **Date conversion** ‚Äì transforms ISO-8601 text dates (`TRTSDTC`, `TRTENDTC`, `BRTHDTC`) into numeric SAS dates (`TRTSDT`, `TRTEDT`, `BRTHDT`).  
2. **Population flags** ‚Äì derives  
   * `SAFFL = "Y"` if `TRTSDT` exists (safety population)  
   * `ITTFL = "Y"`, `EFFFL = "Y"` for every subject (simplified rule).  
3. **Variable ordering** ‚Äì reorders variables to standard ADaM ADSL layout.  
4. **XPT compatibility** ‚Äì renames `ACTARMNRS` ‚Üí `ACTARMRS` before export.

### üßæ Outputs
| File        | Location        | Format |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| `adsl.csv`  | `3_adam/data/`  | CSV    |
| `adsl.xpt`  | `3_adam/data/`  | XPT    |

### üìé Notes
* Flags are intentionally simplified for demonstration; real studies should derive populations per protocol.  
* All data are **synthetic** ‚Äì no real patient information is included.
